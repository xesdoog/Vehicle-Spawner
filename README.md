# Vehicle-Spawner [Currently Useless]
Lua script that spawns GTA V vehicles using YimMenu.

> [!NOTE]
> This script was written for DeadlineEm's [Vehicle Gifting script](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/grand-theft-auto-v/620962-yimmenu-vehicle-gifting.html) which didn't work with YimMenu's vehicle spawner.
>
> Currently, there is no use for either one of them.
